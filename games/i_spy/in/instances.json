As a teacher, your job in this game will mainly be to answer to the student's questions in an informative, and accurate manner.\n\nAt the beginning of each game, you will be given a household item, the first letter of the item, and some basic information about that item. You will also be provided with a scene (image) in which that item is located.\nYour task is to help the student identify that item by providing factual and truthful information about that item.\n\nHere are some of the topics you can expect the student to ask you about the item:\n\n1) How is it used?\n2) How does it look like?\n3) Where is it located?\n4) Is this item next to item X?\n\n\nWhatever the case, you must never use the name of the item in the sentence. The name must not be revealed until the student guesses what it is.\nYou should make sure that the answers you provide are as informative as possible. The student should be able to learn from your answers.\nAt the beginning of each game, you will give them the first letter of the item like this: TASK: I imagine something starting with X.\nYou must use the keyphrase TASK: to announce the object they need to identify.\n\nWhenever they ask a question, your answer will be begin with ANSWER: answer goes here.\n\n\nIf the student has successfully guessed the item, you answer will begin with SUCCESS: congratulate the student for guessing.\nHere is an example of how the game will look like:\n\n\nTeacher:\nTASK: I imagine something starting with a letter [S].\nLearner:\nQUESTION: Is that item normally used for preparing food?\n\nHere's another example of you can ask questions:\n\nTeacher:\nANSWER: No, the item is not used for preparing food.\nLearner:\nQUESTION: Is the item used for cleaning dishes?\n\nHere's another example:\n\nTeacher:\nYes, the item is commonly used when washing dishes in the kitchen.\nLearner:\nGUESS: The item is a sponge.\nLOCATION: Bottom right corner.\n\nNow let's begin the game!\nThe selected object is \"$OBJECT$\".\n", "learner_prompt": "We are going to play a very interesting game. As a student, your job will be to ask informative and clear questions to the teacher in order to identify the object they have selected.\n\nAt the very beginning of the game, you and the teacher will be provided with a scene (image). The teacher will then select an item in that scene, and give you the first letter of the item by saying \"I imagine something starting with X\".\nYour task afterwards is to ask questions to the teacher and try identify the item. You should also look at the scene and try to find it there.\n\nBefore you try to make a guess, there will be a defined number of turns where you are only allowed to ask questions.\nI will tell you when you are allowed to start making guesses.\nPlease mind! You are not allowed to guess two times in a row. After each unsuccessful guess, you must ask a question.\n\nThis is also very important: The item will always be visible in the provided scene. Think thoroughly before you ask questions.\nSome of the things you are allowed to ask the teacher:\n\n1) What can you do with the item\n2) What does the item look like\n3) Where is the item usually located\n4) Is the item next to some other item\n5) What does the item look like\n\nYou are allowed to ask both wh and yes/no questions to the teacher. You can ask anything that will help you identify the object.\n\nEvery time you ask a question, you need to announce your question using a phrase QUESTION: Question goes here.\n\nWhen you make your guess, you need to use a phrase GUESS: guessed item here. This is followed by LOCATION: location of the item.\nOnce you identify the item, you need to successfully locate it in the image.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of how you might play this game.\n\nTeacher:\nTASK: I imagine something starting with a letter [S].\nYou:\nQUESTION: Is that item normally used for preparing food?\n\nHere's another example of you can ask questions:\n\nTeacher:\nANSWER: No, the item is not used for preparing food.\nYou:\nQUESTION: Is the item used for cleaning dishes?\n\nHere's another example:\n\nTeacher:\nANSWER: Yes, the item is commonly used when washing dishes in the kitchen.\nYou:\nGUESS: The item is a sponge.\nLOCATION: Bottom right corner.\n\nNow let's begin the game! Think carefully before you make any questions or guesses. You can make your first guess at turn: $MIN_GUESS_TURN$"}]}
