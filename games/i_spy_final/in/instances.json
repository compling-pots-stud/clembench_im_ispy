You will also be provided with a scene (image) in which that item is located.\nYour task is to help the student identify that item by providing factual and truthful information about that item.\n\nHere are some of the topics you can expect the student to ask you about the item:\n\n1) How is it used?\n2) How does it look like?\n3) Where is it located?\n4) Is this item next to item X?\n\n\nWhatever the case, you must never use the name of the item in the sentence. The name must not be revealed until the student guesses what it is.\nYou should make sure that the answers you provide are as informative as possible. The student should be able to learn from your answers.\nAt the beginning of each game, you will give them the first letter of the item like this: TASK: I imagine something starting with X.\nYou must use the keyphrase TASK: to announce the object they need to identify.\n\nWhenever they ask a question, your answer will be begin with ANSWER: answer goes here.\n\n\nIf the student's guess was successful, you answer will begin with SUCCESS: congratulate the student for guessing.\n\nIn order for the guess to be successful there are three conditions:\n1) The item has to start with the correct letter.\n2) The item needs to be correctly guessed.\n3) The item has to be in the correct location.\n\nAllowed locations are:\n\n1) Top-Left.\n2) Top-Center.\n3) Top-Right.\n4) Middle-Left\n4) Middle-Center\n6) Middle-Right\n7) Bottom-Left.\n8) Bottom-Center.\n9) Bottom-Right.\n\n\nHere is an example of how the game will look like:\n\n<example>\n\n    Teacher:\n    TASK: I imagine something starting with a letter [S].\n    Learner:\n    QUESTION: Is that item normally used for preparing food?\n\n    Here's another example of you can ask questions:\n\n    Teacher:\n    ANSWER: No, the item is not used for preparing food.\n    Learner:\n    QUESTION: Is the item used for cleaning dishes?\n\n    Here's another example:\n\n    Teacher:\n    Yes, the item is commonly used when washing dishes in the kitchen.\n    Learner:\n    GUESS: The item is a sponge.\n    LOCATION: Top-Left.\n\n\n    Here's another example:\n\n    TASK: I imagine something starting with a letter [B].\n    The selected object is Bottle.\n\n    Learner:\n    GUESS: The item is a Soap Bottle.\n    LOCATION: Bottom-Left.\n    The learner has made a mistake: The initial letter of the guessed item was not correct.\n    Therefore, the guess is not correct.

Think carefully before asking questions or making guesses.\n\n\nBefore you try to make a guess, there will be a defined number of turns where you are only allowed to ask questions.\nI will tell you when you are allowed to start making guesses.\nPlease mind! You are not allowed to guess two times in a row. After each unsuccessful guess, you must ask a question.\n\n\nScene Inspection:\nUse inspection tags to describe what you see:\n\n<inspect>\n    I am in a modern kitchen. I can see stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, and wooden cabinets. There's a window above the sink letting in natural light.\n</inspect>\n\nStrategic Thinking:\nUse thinking tags to analyze the situation:\n\n<thinking>\n    Given that the object starts with 'B' and is found in a kitchen, but isn't used for cooking, it might be related to cleaning or storage. The presence of a sink area suggests I should investigate cleaning implements.\n</thinking>\n\nMental Maps:\nUse navigate tags to construct mental maps of your surroundings. This will come in handy when navigating the space.\n\n<navigate>\n    Current view: Kitchen entrance\n    - Left: Visible portion of countertop\n    - Center: Cabinet section\n    - Right: More kitchen appliances (refrigerator)\n    - Upper cabinets: Visible but distant\n</navigate>\n\nEvery turn must include both inspection and thinking tags, as well as navigate tags, regardless of whether you're asking a question or making a guess.\n\n\nThis is very important: The item will always be visible in the provided scene.

They are just here for the purpose of explanation.\n\nFor Questions:\nANSWER: [Your informative response]\n[Provide a hint, either what is visible in their environment, or a suggestion on where they could move next.  However, NEVER tell the learner the exact location of the object.]\n\nFor Guesses:\nSUCCESS: [Congratulatory message] (if correct)\nor\nINCORRECT: [Explanation of why the guess was wrong]\n\nRESPONSE RULES\n\n1. Never use the actual object name in your answers\n2. Base responses only on what is currently visible in the scene\n3. If the student moves or looks around, acknowledge what is visible from the new viewpoint\n4. Provide specific, informative answers that help learning\n5. Never provide the exact location of the item. The learner needs to find it on their own.\n\nSUCCESSFUL GUESS REQUIREMENTS\n\nAll three conditions must be met:\n1. Correct first letter\n2. Correct item name\n3. Correct location\n\nValid locations:\n- Top-Left, Top-Center, Top-Right\n- Middle-Left, Middle-Center, Middle-Right\n- Bottom-Left, Bottom-Center, Bottom-Right\n\nThe object location is relative to the image, not another object. So if the location is top-left, it means that it is in the top-left corner of the image.\nPlease always refer to the location in this way, and do not confuse the learner.\n\nEXAMPLE GAMEPLAY\n\nTurn 1:\nTeacher:\nTASK: I imagine something starting with a letter [S].\n\nStudent:\nQUESTION: Is that item normally used for preparing food?\nLOOK: left\n\nTeacher:\nANSWER: No, the item is not used for preparing food.\n\nTurn 2:\nStudent:\nQUESTION: Is the item used for cleaning dishes?\nLOOK: down\n\nTeacher:\nANSWER: Yes, the item is commonly used when washing dishes in the kitchen.\n\nTurn 3:\nStudent:\nGUESS: Sponge\nLOCATION: Bottom-Right\n\nTeacher:\nSUCCESS: Excellent work! You correctly identified the object in its location at the bottom right of the sink area.\n\nEXAMPLE OF INCORRECT GUESS\n\nTurn 1:\nTeacher:\nTASK: I imagine something starting with a letter [B].\n(Selected object is Bottle)\n\nStudent:\nGUESS: Soap Bottle\nLOCATION: Bottom-Left\n\nTeacher:\nINCORRECT: While your guess is close, this word doesn't match our criteria. Remember, we're looking for something that starts with 'B'. Try asking a question about the object's purpose to narrow down your options.\n\nIMPORTANT REMINDERS\n\n1. Always acknowledge the student's movement or look commands by describing what is now visible\n2. Keep track of what should be visible from the current viewpoint\n3. Provide feedback that encourages learning and exploration\n4. Never reveal information about areas that aren't visible from the current viewpoint\n5. Maintain consistency in your answers as the student explores the scene\n6. Remember, you must never say the name of the object! Even if the learner has successfully guessed.\n\n\nThis is the most important piece of information: Look at the image before answering to the learner! Do not tell them that an item is visible if it is not.\nYou can use the following tags as thinking space: <think> THINKING SPACE </think>\n\nThink thoroughly before you answer!\nNow let's begin the game!\nSelected object: \"$OBJECT$\"\n", "learner_prompt": "Multimodal Interactive Learning Game\n\nWelcome to the Interactive Object Identification Game! In this learning exercise, you'll take on the role of a student trying to identify objects in a 3D scene through strategic questioning and exploration.\n\nGAME OVERVIEW\n\nYou are an AI student placed in a 3D scene with a teacher. The teacher will select an object and give you its first letter. Your goal is to:\n1. Navigate the scene effectively\n2. Ask informative questions about the object\n3. Successfully identify and locate the object\n\nTURN STRUCTURE\n\nEach turn, you may perform ONE of the following actions:\n1. Ask a question AND perform one look command\n   Example:\n   QUESTION: Is the object electrical?\n   LOOK: left\n\n2. Make a guess (including location)\n   Example:\n   GUESS: Blender\n   LOCATION: Top-Right\n\nImportant Notes:\n- After making any look command, you will see the new view on your next turn\n- You cannot make multiple looks in one turn\n- You cannot ask a question and make a guess in the same turn\n- You cannot make multiple questions in one turn\n\nCore Game Rules:\n- You are only allowed to guess on a turn when you are told so. Not obeying this rule will result in a aborted game.\n- After an incorrect guess, you must ask at least one question before guessing again. You will always be reminded when you are allowed to guess.\n- The target object might not be visible in every frame. You will have to navigate the scene and find it.\n- Points are awarded for creative and informative questions\n- You are not allowed to guess unless you use the GUESS keyword. You must not use QUESTION to make a guess. It will result in an aborted game.\n\nNAVIGATION COMMANDS\n\nLooking Around (ONE per turn, combined with a question):\nUse LOOK: direction to adjust your view (30-degree increments):\n- up - Tilt camera up\n- down - Tilt camera down\n- left - Pan camera left\n- right - Pan camera right\n- none - The camera does not move\n\n\nNote: Some moves might not be possible. The teacher will inform you if a command cannot be executed.\n\nIf you wish to not move from the current position, you can say LOOK: none -> This will keep you where you are.\n\nWhen looking around, construct a mental map of the surrounding area. Try to remember what you have seen and where. You can use the thinking for this!\n\nGAME COMMUNICATION\n\nScene Inspection:\nUse inspection tags to describe what you see:\n\n<inspect>\n    I am in a modern kitchen. I can see stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, and wooden cabinets. There's a window above the sink letting in natural light.\n</inspect>\n\nStrategic Thinking:\nUse thinking tags to analyze the situation:\n\n<thinking>\n    Given that the object starts with 'B' and is found in a kitchen, but isn't used for cooking, it might be related to cleaning or storage. The presence of a sink area suggests I should investigate cleaning implements.\n</thinking>\n\nMental Maps:\nUse navigate tags to construct mental maps of your surroundings. This will come in handy when navigating the space.\n\n<navigate>\n    Current view: Kitchen entrance\n    - Left: Visible portion of countertop\n    - Center: Cabinet section\n    - Right: More kitchen appliances (refrigerator)\n    - Upper cabinets: Visible but distant\n</navigate>\n\nEvery turn must include both inspection and thinking tags, as well as navigate tags, regardless of whether you're asking a question or making a guess.\n\nValid locations for guesses:\n- Top-Left, Top-Center, Top-Right\n- Middle-Left, Middle-Center, Middle-Right\n- Bottom-Left, Bottom-Center, Bottom-Right\n\nPlease remember: the guess location is relative to the item's position on the screen, not another object. Always say where the item is in the provided image.\n\nEXAMPLE GAMEPLAY SCENARIOS\nNOTE: Turn numbers are only examplary. You are obviously not allowed to guess when you are not told you can do it.\nScenario 1: Kitchen Scene\n\n    Teacher: I imagine something starting with [B]\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n    I'm in a kitchen with modern appliances. There's a sink area, countertops, and various cabinets.\n    </inspect>\n\n    <navigate>\n        Current view: Facing kitchen entrance\n        - Left side: Sink area with some cabinets above\n        - Center: Counter space with some appliances\n        - Right side: Not visible yet, need to look right\n    </navigate>\n\n    <thinking>\n        For objects starting with 'B' in a kitchen, I should consider both cooking implements and general kitchen items. I should check the right side to see more of the counter space.\n    </thinking>\n\n    QUESTION: Is this object used for food preparation?\n    LOOK: right\n\n    Teacher:\n    Yes, this object is used in food preparation.\n\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n        Now I can see more counter space with several appliances on it. There's a coffee maker and some other small appliances, but nothing starting with 'B' visible yet.\n    </inspect>\n    <navigate>\n        Updated view after looking right:\n        - Previously seen (left): Sink area\n        - Previously seen (center): Main counter with appliances\n        - Current view: Additional counter space, coffee maker\n        - Far right corner: Still not visible, might need another look right\n    </navigate>\n    <thinking>\n        Since it's used for food prep and starts with 'B', possible items could be blender, bowl, or baking dish. The electrical appliances seem to be arranged along the counter, so I should continue looking right.\n    </thinking>\n    QUESTION: Is it an electrical appliance?\n    LOOK: right\n\n    Teacher: Yes, it is electrical.\n\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n        I can now see a blender in the far corner of the counter.\n    </inspect>\n    <navigate>\n        Complete view after second look right:\n        - Far left (previous): Sink area\n        - Center-left (previous): Main counter with small appliances\n        - Center-right (previous): Coffee maker area\n        - Current view: Far right corner with blender\n    </navigate>\n    <thinking>\n        An electrical appliance used for food prep starting with 'B' strongly suggests the blender I can now see in the corner. The location and characteristics match all our criteria.\n    </thinking>\n    GUESS: Blender\n    LOCATION: Top-Right\n\nScenario 2: Living Room Scene\n\n    Teacher: I imagine something starting with [L]\n\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n        I'm in a living room with various furniture pieces and decorative items.\n    </inspect>\n    <navigate>\n        Current view: Living room front view\n        - Floor level: Sofa, coffee table visible\n        - Eye level: Wall decorations\n        - Upper area: Not visible yet\n        - Corners: Partially visible\n    </navigate>\n    <thinking>\n        For items starting with 'L', I should consider typical living room items like lamp, loveseat, or light fixture. Since I can't see the ceiling yet, I should look up.\n    </thinking>\n    QUESTION: Does this object provide illumination?\n    LOOK: up\n\n    Teacher: Yes, it provides light.\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n        Looking up, I can now see various lighting fixtures on the ceiling and walls.\n    </inspect>\n    <navigate>\n        Current view (looking up):\n        - Ceiling: Multiple light fixtures\n        - Upper walls: Wall-mounted lights\n        - Left corner: Tall floor lamp visible\n        - Right corner: Wall sconces\n    </navigate>\n    <thinking>\n        A light source starting with 'L' is likely a lamp. I can see several lighting fixtures from this angle.\n    </thinking>\n    QUESTION: Is it a standing fixture?\n    LOOK: left\n\n    Teacher: Yes, it's a standing fixture.\n\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n        I can now see a tall floor lamp in the corner. It has a modern design with a brass finish and white shade.\n    </inspect>\n    <navigate>\n        Current view (left side):\n        - Left corner: Floor lamp with brass finish\n        - Previously seen ceiling: Light fixtures\n        - Previously seen right side: Wall sconces\n    </navigate>\n    <thinking>\n        The object matches all our criteria: it starts with 'L', provides illumination, and is a standing fixture. Its location in the corner makes it a clear candidate.\n    </thinking>\n    GUESS: Lamp\n    LOCATION: Middle-Left\n\n\nScenario 3: Home Office Scene\n\n\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n    I'm in a home office with a desk setup, some storage solutions, and various office supplies.\n    </inspect>\n    <navigate>\n        Current view: Office front view\n        - Left: Storage shelves and filing cabinets\n        - Center: Main desk with supplies\n        - Right: Partially visible side table\n        - Lower area: Under desk, not visible\n    </navigate>\n    <thinking>\n        In an office, items starting with 'P' could include printer, pencil, pen, or paper tray. Let me check the right side first.\n    </thinking>\n    QUESTION: Is this item commonly used with paper?\n    LOOK: right\n\n    Teacher: Yes, it's used with paper.\n\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n        I can now see a printer on a side table and various paper supplies.\n    </inspect>\n    <navigate>\n        Current view (right side):\n        - Side table with printer\n        - Paper supplies arranged nearby\n        - Previously seen desk area\n        - Lower areas still not visible\n    </navigate>\n    <thinking>\n        Since it's used with paper, it could be a printer, pencil, or pen. I should make a guess since I see a printer.\n    </thinking>\n    GUESS: Printer\n    LOCATION: Middle-Right\n    Teacher: Incorrect. Remember, you must ask at least one more question before guessing again.\n    <thinking>\n        I need to narrow down the options. Since the printer was wrong, it might be a smaller paper-related item.\n    </thinking>\n    QUESTION: Is this item handheld?\n    LOOK: down\n\n    Teacher: Yes, it's handheld.\n\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n        Looking at the desk surface, I can see various writing implements.\n    </inspect>\n    <navigate>\n        Current view (desk surface):\n        - Desktop area with writing implements\n        - Pen holder at bottom-center\n        - Previously seen printer to the right\n        - Previously seen storage to the left\n    </navigate>\n    <thinking>\n        The starting letter is [P]. There is a Pen on the table.\n    </thinking>\n    GUESS: Pen\n    LOCATION: Bottom-Center\n\n\nScenario 4: Kitchen Scene\n    Teacher: I imagine something starting with [C]\n    You: <inspect>\n        I'm at the kitchen entrance. I can see some countertops and cabinets, but part of the kitchen is around the corner.\n    </inspect>\n    <thinking>\n        Many kitchen items start with 'C': cup, colander, coffee maker, cutting board. I should first determine if it's an appliance.\n    </thinking>\n    QUESTION: Is this an electrical appliance?\n    LOOK: DOWN\n\nTIPS FOR SUCCESS\n\n1. Plan your movements carefully - each movement uses up a turn\n2. Use your thinking time to plan multiple turns ahead\n3. Combine questions with strategic movements to gather maximum information per turn\n4. Consider the room context when planning your questions and movements\n5. Use process of elimination in your thinking\n6. Remember you can only perform one look command per turn\n7. Don't be afraid to look around. Sometimes, the object is not in your frame.\n8. Don't hesitate to look around to explore the scene. The object might be behind you!\n9. If you are certain that the object is in your frame, you don't need to move your camera!\n10. Do not make a guess unless explicitly told you are allowed to.\n11. Listen to your teacher! They will sometimes provide hints. E.g. if they say the object is too far away, move closer to it!\n12. Always use both inspect and thinking tags on every turn, even when making a guess\n13. When making a guess, use the inspect tags to describe what you see that confirms your choice\n14. Use thinking tags to explain your reasoning for making a particular guess and choosing a specific location\n\n\n\n\nRemember: Your goal is to identify the object efficiently while demonstrating strategic thinking in both your questions and movements.", "learner_mistake_prompt": "The learner has made a mistake: $MISTAKE$\nTherefore, the guess is not correct.

Correct location\n\nValid locations:\n- Top-Left, Top-Center, Top-Right\n- Middle-Left, Middle-Center, Middle-Right\n- Bottom-Left, Bottom-Center, Bottom-Right\n\nEXAMPLE GAMEPLAY\n\nTurn 1:\nTeacher:\nTASK: I imagine something starting with a letter [S].\n\nStudent:\nQUESTION: Is that item normally used for preparing food?\nMOVE: forward\n\nTeacher:\nANSWER: No, the item is not used for preparing food.\n\nTurn 2:\nStudent:\nQUESTION: Is the item used for cleaning dishes?\nLOOK: down\n\nTeacher:\nANSWER: Yes, the item is commonly used when washing dishes in the kitchen.\n\nTurn 3:\nStudent:\nGUESS: Sponge\nLOCATION: Bottom-Right\n\nTeacher:\nSUCCESS: Excellent work! You correctly identified the object in its location at the bottom right of the sink area.\n\nEXAMPLE OF INCORRECT GUESS\n\nTurn 1:\nTeacher:\nTASK: I imagine something starting with a letter [B].\n(Selected object is Bottle)\n\nStudent:\nGUESS: Soap Bottle\nLOCATION: Bottom-Left\n\nTeacher:\nINCORRECT: While your guess is close, this word doesn't match our criteria. Remember, we're looking for something that starts with 'B'. Try asking a question about the object's purpose to narrow down your options.\n\nIMPORTANT REMINDERS\n\n1. Always acknowledge the student's movement or look commands by describing what is now visible\n2. Keep track of what should be visible from the current viewpoint\n3. Provide feedback that encourages learning and exploration\n4. Never reveal information about areas that aren't visible from the current viewpoint\n5. Maintain consistency in your answers as the student explores the scene\n6. Remember, you must never say the name of the object! Even if the learner has successfully guessed.\n\n\nThis is the most important piece of information: Look at the image before answering to the learner! Do not tell them that an item is visible if it is not.\nYou can use the following tags as thinking space: <think> THINKING SPACE </think>\n\nThink thoroughly before you answer!\nNow let's begin the game!\nSelected object: \"$OBJECT$\"\n", "learner_prompt": "Multimodal Interactive Learning Game\n\nWelcome to the Interactive Object Identification Game! In this learning exercise, you'll take on the role of a student trying to identify objects in a 3D scene through strategic questioning and exploration.\n\nGAME OVERVIEW\n\nYou are an AI student placed in a 3D scene with a teacher. The teacher will select an object and give you its first letter. Your goal is to:\n1. Navigate the scene effectively\n2. Ask informative questions about the object\n3. Successfully identify and locate the object\n\nTURN STRUCTURE\n\nEach turn, you may perform ONE of the following actions:\n1. Ask a question AND perform one movement/look command\n   Example:\n   QUESTION: Is the object electrical?\n   MOVE: forward\n\n2. Make a guess (including location)\n   Example:\n   GUESS: Blender\n   LOCATION: Top-Right\n\nImportant Notes:\n- After making any movement or look command, you will see the new view on your next turn\n- You cannot make multiple movements in one turn\n- You cannot ask a question and make a guess in the same turn\n- You cannot make multiple questions in one turn\n\nCore Game Rules:\n- You are only allowed to guess on a turn when you are told so. Not obeying this rule will result in a aborted game.\n- After an incorrect guess, you must ask at least one question before guessing again. You will always be reminded when you are allowed to guess.\n- The target object might not be visible in every frame. You will have to navigate the scene and find it.\n- Points are awarded for creative and informative questions\n- You are not allowed to guess unless you use the GUESS keyword. You must not use QUESTION to make a guess. It will result in an aborted game.\n\nNAVIGATION COMMANDS\n\nMovement (ONE per turn, combined with a question):\nUse MOVE: direction to move through the scene:\n\n- forward - Step forward\n- backward - Step backward\n- left - Lateral step left\n- right - Lateral step right\n- none - You stay where you are\n\nLooking Around (ONE per turn, combined with a question):\nUse LOOK: direction to adjust your view (30-degree increments):\n- up - Tilt camera up\n- down - Tilt camera down\n- left - Pan camera left\n- right - Pan camera right\n- none - The camera does not move\n\nTurning (ONE per turn, combined with a question):\nUse TURN: direction for larger rotations:\n- left - 90° left turn\n- right - 90° right turn\n- behind - 180° turn\n\nNote: Some movements may be blocked by walls or objects. The teacher will inform you if a command cannot be executed.\n\nIf you wish to not move from the current position, you can say LOOK: none or MOVE: none-> This will keep you where you are.\n\nWhen moving around, construct a mental map of the surrounding area. Try to remember what you have seen and where. You can use the thinking for this!\n\nGAME COMMUNICATION\n\nScene Inspection:\nUse inspection tags to describe what you see:\n\n<inspect>\n    I am in a modern kitchen. I can see stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, and wooden cabinets. There's a window above the sink letting in natural light.\n</inspect>\n\nStrategic Thinking:\nUse thinking tags to analyze the situation:\n\n<thinking>\n    Given that the object starts with 'B' and is found in a kitchen, but isn't used for cooking, it might be related to cleaning or storage. The presence of a sink area suggests I should investigate cleaning implements.\n</thinking>\n\nEvery turn must include both inspection and thinking tags, regardless of whether you're asking a question or making a guess.\n\nValid locations for guesses:\n- Top-Left, Top-Center, Top-Right\n- Middle-Left, Middle-Center, Middle-Right\n- Bottom-Left, Bottom-Center, Bottom-Right\n\nEXAMPLE GAMEPLAY SCENARIOS\nNOTE: Turn numbers are only examplary. You are obviously not allowed to guess when you are not told you can do it.\nScenario 1: Kitchen Scene\n\n    Teacher: I imagine something starting with [B]\n\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n        I'm in a kitchen with modern appliances. There's a sink area, countertops, and various cabinets.\n    </inspect>\n    <navigate>\n        Current view: Facing kitchen entrance\n        - Left side: Sink area with some cabinets above\n        - Center: Counter space with some appliances\n        - Right side: Not visible yet, need to look right\n    </navigate>\n\n    <thinking>\n        For objects starting with 'B' in a kitchen, I should consider both cooking implements and general kitchen items. I should look to the right to see more of the counter space.\n    </thinking>\n\n    QUESTION: Is this object used for food preparation?\n    LOOK: right\n\n    Teacher: Yes, this object is used in food preparation.\n\n    <inspect>\n        Now I can see more counter space with several appliances on it.\n    </inspect>\n\n    <navigate>\n        Updated view after looking right:\n        - Previously seen (left): Sink area\n        - Previously seen (center): Main counter with appliances\n        - Current view: Additional counter space, coffee maker\n        - Far right corner: Still not visible, might need another look right\n    </navigate>\n\n    <thinking>\n        Since it's used for food prep and starts with 'B', possible items could be blender, bowl, or baking dish. The appliances are distant, however, so I should move closer.\n    </thinking>\n\n    QUESTION: Is it an electrical appliance?\n    MOVE: forward\n\n    Teacher: Yes, it is electrical.\n\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n        I can now see a blender in the far corner of the counter.\n    </inspect>\n    <navigate>\n        Complete view after second look right:\n        - Far left (previous): Sink area\n        - Center-left (previous): Main counter with small appliances\n        - Center-right (previous): Coffee maker area\n        - Current view: Closer look of the countertop. I definitely see a blender now.\n    </navigate>\n    <thinking>\n        An electrical appliance used for food prep starting with 'B' strongly suggests the blender I can now see in the corner. The location and characteristics match all our criteria.\n    </thinking>\n    GUESS: Blender\n    LOCATION: Top-Right\n\nScenario 2: Living Room Scene\n\n    Teacher: I imagine something starting with [L]\n\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n        I'm in a living room with various furniture pieces and decorative items.\n    </inspect>\n\n    <navigate>\n        Current view: Living room entrance\n        - Left side: Seating area\n        - Center: Coffee table and some decor\n        - Right side: More furniture, might need to look right\n    </navigate>\n\n    <thinking>\n        In a living room, objects starting with 'L' could include lamp, loveseat, or lounge chair. Since lighting is essential, I should check higher areas first.\n    </thinking>\n\n    QUESTION: Does this object provide illumination?\n    LOOK: up\n\n    Teacher: Yes, it provides light.\n\n    <inspect>\n        Looking up, I can now see various lighting fixtures on the ceiling and walls.\n    </inspect>\n\n    <navigate>\n        Updated view after looking up:\n        - Ceiling area: Various lighting fixtures\n        - Walls: Some wall-mounted lights\n        - Corner areas: Tall standing lamps visible\n    </navigate>\n\n    <thinking>\n        A light source starting with 'L' is likely a lamp. I should move forward to get a better view of the corner fixture.\n    </thinking>\n\n    QUESTION: Is it a standing fixture?\n    TURN: right\n\n    Teacher: Yes, it's a standing fixture.\n\n    <inspect>\n        I can now see a tall floor lamp in the corner. It has a modern design with a brass finish and white shade.\n    </inspect>\n\n    <navigate>\n        Current view after turning right:\n        - Left corner: Tall floor lamp clearly visible\n        - Center: Window area\n        - Right side: Bookshelf and decor\n    </navigate>\n\n    <thinking>\n        The object matches all our criteria: it starts with 'L', provides illumination, and is a standing fixture. Its location in the corner makes it a clear candidate.\n    </thinking>\n\n    GUESS: Lamp\n    LOCATION: Middle-Left\n\nScenario 3: Home Office Scene\n\n\n    You:\n    <inspect>\n        I'm in a home office with a desk setup, some storage solutions, and various office supplies.\n    </inspect>\n\n    <navigate>\n        Current view: Office entrance\n        - Left: Desk with computer setup\n        - Center: Office chair and some storage\n        - Right: Side table with office equipment\n    </navigate>\n\n    <thinking>\n        In an office setting, many items could start with [P]: printer, pencil, pen, paper, planner. I should first determine if it's related to paper use.\n    </thinking>\n\n    QUESTION: Is this item commonly used with paper?\n    LOOK: right\n\n    Teacher: Yes, it's used with paper.\n\n    <inspect>\n        I can now see a printer on a side table and various paper supplies.\n    </inspect>\n\n    <navigate>\n        Updated view after looking right:\n        - Previous view (left): Desk setup\n        - Center: Storage area\n        - Current view (right): Side table with printer and paper supplies\n    </navigate>\n\n    <thinking>\n        Since it's used with paper, it could be a printer, pencil, or pen. I should make a guess since I see a printer.\n    </thinking>\n\n    GUESS: Printer\n    LOCATION: Middle-Right\n\n    Teacher: Incorrect. Remember, you must ask at least one more question before guessing again.\n\n    <thinking>\n        I need to narrow down the options. Since the printer was wrong, it might be a smaller paper-related item.\n    </thinking>\n\n    QUESTION: Is this item handheld?\n    LOOK: down\n\n    Teacher: Yes, it's handheld.\n\n    <inspect>\n        Looking at the desk surface, I can see various writing implements.\n    </inspect>\n\n    <navigate>\n        Updated view after looking down:\n        - Desk surface visible\n        - Various writing implements scattered\n        - Clear view of a pen in the center\n    </navigate>\n\n    <thinking>\n        The starting letter is [P]. There is a Pen on the table, and it matches all our criteria: handheld, used with paper, and visible on the desk.\n    </thinking>\n\n    GUESS: Pen\n    LOCATION: Bottom-Center\n\nScenario 6: Kitchen Scene\n    Teacher: I imagine something starting with [C]\n    You: <inspect>\n        I'm at the kitchen entrance. I can see some countertops and cabinets, but part of the kitchen is around the corner.\n    </inspect>\n    <thinking>\n        Many kitchen items start with 'C': cup, colander, coffee maker, cutting board. I should first determine if it's an appliance.\n    </thinking>\n    QUESTION: Is this an electrical appliance?\n    MOVE: forward\n\nTIPS FOR SUCCESS\n\n1. Plan your movements carefully - each movement uses up a turn\n2. Use your thinking time to plan multiple turns ahead\n3. Combine questions with strategic movements to gather maximum information per turn\n4. Consider the room context when planning your questions and movements\n5. Use process of elimination in your thinking\n6. Remember you can only perform one movement or look command per turn\n7. If an item is far away, move towards it.\n8. Don't be afraid to look around. Sometimes, the object is not in your frame.\n9. Don't hesitate to look around to explore the scene.\n10. Do not make a guess unless explicitly told you are allowed to.\n11. Listen to your teacher! They will sometimes provide hints. E.g. if they say the object is too far away, move closer to it!\n12. Always use both inspect and thinking tags on every turn, even when making a guess\n13. When making a guess, use the inspect tags to describe what you see that confirms your choice\n14. Use thinking tags to explain your reasoning for making a particular guess and choosing a specific location\n15. If you are certain that the object is in your frame, you don't need to move!\n\n\n\n\nRemember: Your goal is to identify the object efficiently while demonstrating strategic thinking in both your questions and movements.", "learner_mistake_prompt": "The learner has made a mistake: $MISTAKE$\nTherefore, the guess is not correct. Please let them know what mistake they have made.", "move_error_prompt": "Unfortunately, your move is not allowed due to the following reason: $ERROR$"}]}
