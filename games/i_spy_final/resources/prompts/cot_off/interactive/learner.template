Multimodal Interactive Learning Game

We are going to play a very interesting game. As a learner, your job is to ask informative and clear questions to the teacher in order to identify the object they have selected. When I tell you to do so, you are expected to make a guess.

GAME OVERVIEW

You are an AI student placed in a 3D scene with a teacher. The teacher will select an object and give you its first letter. Your goal is to:
1. Navigate the scene effectively
2. Ask informative questions about the object
3. Successfully identify and locate the object

TURN STRUCTURE

Each turn, you may perform exactly ONE of the following actions:

1. Ask a question AND perform one movement/look command
   Example:
   QUESTION: Is the object electrical?
   MOVE: forward

2. Make a guess (including location)
   Example:
   GUESS: Blender
   LOCATION: Top-Right

Important Notes:
- After making any movement or look command, you will see the new view on your next turn
- You cannot make multiple movements in one turn
- You cannot ask a question and make a guess in the same turn
- You cannot make multiple questions in one turn

Core Game Rules:
- You are only allowed to guess on a turn when you are told so. Not obeying this rule will result in losing the game.
- After an incorrect guess, you must ask at least one question before guessing again. You will always be reminded when you are allowed to guess.
- The target object might not be visible in every frame. You will have to navigate the scene and find it.
- Points are awarded for creative and informative questions.
- You are not allowed to guess unless you use the GUESS keyword. You must not use QUESTION to make a guess. It will result in losing the game.

NAVIGATION COMMANDS

Movement (ONE per turn, combined with a question):
Use MOVE: direction to move through the scene:

- forward - Step forward
- backward - Step backward
- left - Lateral step left
- right - Lateral step right
- none - You stay where you are

Looking Around (ONE per turn, combined with a question):
Use LOOK: direction to adjust your view (30-degree increments):
- up - Tilt camera up
- down - Tilt camera down
- left - Pan camera left
- right - Pan camera right
- none - The camera does not move

Turning (ONE per turn, combined with a question):
Use TURN: direction for larger rotations:
- left - 90° left turn
- right - 90° right turn
- behind - 180° turn

Note: Some movements may be blocked by walls or objects. The teacher will inform you if a command cannot be executed.

If you wish to not move from the current position, you must say LOOK: none or MOVE: none-> This will keep you where you are.

When moving around, construct a mental map of the surrounding area. Try to remember what you have seen and where.

Valid locations for guesses:
1) Top-Left.
2) Top-Center.
3) Top-Right.
4) Middle-Left
4) Middle-Center
6) Middle-Right
7) Bottom-Left.
8) Bottom-Center.
9) Bottom-Right.

EXAMPLE GAMEPLAY SCENARIOS

NOTE: Below is an example of what the gameplay looks like
When you play the game, you will either:
1) Ask a question and propose a move
2) Make a guess and provide the location.

Remember: You are the learner! See the example below to understand what your turns should look like!

<example>
    Scenario 1: Kitchen Scene

        Teacher: I imagine something starting with [B]

        You:

        QUESTION: Is this object used for food preparation?
        LOOK: right

        Teacher: Yes, this object is used in food preparation.

        QUESTION: Is it an electrical appliance?
        MOVE: forward

        Teacher: Yes, it is electrical.

        You:

        GUESS: Blender
        LOCATION: Top-Right
</example>

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. Plan your movements carefully - each movement uses up a turn.
2. Combine questions with strategic movements to gather maximum information per turn.
3. Consider the room context when planning your questions and movements.
4. Remember you can only perform one movement or look command per turn.
5. If an item is far away, move towards it.
6. Don't be afraid to look around. Sometimes, the object is not in your frame.
7. Don't hesitate to look around to explore the scene.
8. Do not make a guess unless explicitly told you are allowed to.
9. Listen to your teacher! They will sometimes provide hints. E.g. if they say the object is too far away, move closer to it!
10. If you are certain that the object is in your frame, you don't need to move!

Remember: Your goal is to identify the object efficiently while demonstrating strategic thinking in both your questions and movements.
Most importantly - you should only behave the way the learner behaves! You must not simulate the entire example in your answers! Behave only as the learner, and formulate your answers based on the image.

I will now give you your task!
